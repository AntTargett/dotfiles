## Dotfiles :wrench:

Personal dotfiles inspired by Nick Waywood and Nick Nisi

Includes config files for:
- zsh 
- neovim
- tmux 
- vscode


## Setup 

Clone the repo into home folder
`$ git clone git@github.com:AntTargett/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`

Then run 

`$ ./install.sh`
 from the dotfiles folder
 
 This will install applications and language support as well as symlink the zsh file. 
 
 NOTE: Will remove previous zshrc so make sure a copy is saved
